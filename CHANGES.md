ch.vorburger.xtendbeans Release Notes
=====================================


v1.3.0 @ 2017-07-04
---

* Support Builder classes without getters, only setters (see new @Test with BeanWithNoGettersBuilderBuilder)
  such as those generated by https://immutables.github.io (see also https://github.com/immutables/immutables/issues/432)
  via use of the new ReflectUtils, instead of org.mockito.cglib.core.ReflectUtils (which was based on java.beans.*)
  see also https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8800
* Added slf4j, and log exceptions occurring during object introspection by reflection
* Bumped xtend.version from 2.11.0 to 2.12.0
* Bumped Guava version, to be able to use Google Truth


v1.2.3 @ 2017-03-29
---

* Fixed bug re. constructors with primitives type arguments (default value 0 related issue)
* Support all Iterable, not just List
* Fixed confusing "empty" new expression occurring e.g. for anonymous inner classes
* Bumped xtend.version from 2.10.0 to 2.11.0


v1.2.2 @ 2017-01-23
---

* POM use mockito-core instead of mockito-all, which is bad dangerous substance abuse (because it included outdated hamcrest; non-shadowed)
* POM now explicitly depends on objenesis, which used to be in mockito-all (non-shadowed), as scope compile instead of runtime (due to above)
* Bumped xtend.version from 2.9.2 to 2.10.0


v1.2.1 @ 2017-01-10
---

* Support "union" kind of pattern classes (see also https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7498)
* Fixed spurious end of line new line characters which should not be there if only invoking constructor
* Test for possible future support of objects with factory methods and private constructor


v1.2.0 @ 2016-09-01
---

* Support setters that don't return void, as typically found on Builder classes
* Support matching constructor arguments by type instead name
* Support properties of type Map (incl. via addXXX methods)
* Support Class instances (customizable name/simpleName)
* Customizable extra additional special properties
* Customizable arbitrary extra initialization code
* Customizable Property filtering (e.g. exclusion)
* Fixed possible NullPointerException in assertEqualByText()


v1.1.0 @ 2016-08-29

* Documentation in README
