/**
 * Utility similar to core JUnit's {@link Assert} but with particular support
 * for Java Beans & Value Objects, based on the {@link XtendBeanGenerator}.
 *
 * <p>
 * These methods can be used directly:
 * <code>AssertBeans.assertEqualBeans(...)</code>, however, they read better if
 * they are referenced through static import:<br>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import static ch.vorburger.xtendbeans.AssertBeans.assertEqualBeans;
 *    ...
 *    assertEqualBeans(expected, actual);
 * </pre>
 *
 * The expected object would typically have been defined in a *.xtend source
 * file, and the actual object would typically be an instance of something
 * created by a test.  Any mismatch will be shown in a very readable textual
 * format. This format is suitable for copy/paste into an for the expected
 * object.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that your IDE can support you to create the static import. For example
 * in Eclipse, type: AssertBeans &lt;Ctrl-Space&gt; (will import AssertBeans,
 * non static) . &lt;Ctrl-Space&gt; (will auto-complete assertEqualBeans). Now
 * cursor back to highlight "assertEqualBeans" and Ctrl-Shift-M on it will turn
 * it into a static import.
